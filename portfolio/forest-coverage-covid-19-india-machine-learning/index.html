                <!-- Preliminary evidence in the United States (as of mid 2020) suggested that environmental factors such as
                forest density and air quality may have an impact on Covid-19 transmission and deaths. Using open source
                data, I employ machine learning techniques to predict Covid-19 cases and deaths in India from forest
                coverage and air quality data. The model's prediction suggests that higher populated and polluted states
                will likely have higher cases and deaths from Covid-19.

                <p>The Covid-19 virus spreads respiratorily as people come in contact with one another. Preliminary
                    evidence in the United States (as of November 2020) indicated that environmental factors such as
                    forest
                    density and air quality may have an impact on the spread and mortality rate of Covid-19 (<a

                    <li>Air quality depends on the capacity of trees to remove air pollutants and eliminate volatile
                        organic compounds that contribute to ozone and PM2.5 formation (<a
                            href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.3420404" target="_blank">Chameides et
                            al.,1988</a>).</li>
                    <li>India has high air pollution from urbanization and industry, particularly from the energy sector
                        which might worsen the transmission of Covid-19 (<a

                </ul>

                <p>This analysis investigates the relationship between forest coverage and air quality with the number
                    of Covid-19 cases in India. It aims to answer the following question: <em>Does high forest coverage
                        slow the spread of Covid-19 and minimize cases in India due to better air quality?</em></p>

                <p>The data used in this analysis is from open source resources:</p>

                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Conduct exploratory data analysis by each Indian state, examining the following three main
                        variable groups: air quality, health and demographic, and Covid-19 cases.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Air quality variables are total area of forest, the forest cover value, and mean
                                pollution.</li>
                            <li>Health and demographic variables are slum, work and total population, urban share,
                                population density and number of doctors and hospitals.</li>
                            <li>Covid-19 variables are total cases and deaths.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Apply spatial visualization, regression, and clustering algorithms to identify patterns and
                        relationships between variables.</li>
                </ol>


                <h2>Data Collection and Interrogation</h2>

                <p><strong>Covid-19 data</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data from January 30 to April 26, 2020 from the Data Development Lab India (DLL India).
                        Files used: covid_cases_deaths_district.csv, covid_deaths_recoveries.csv, and
                        covid_infected_deaths.csv</li>
                    <li>The following operations were done:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Renamed the state names according to the state name in shapefile</li>
                            <li>Merged Covid_cases_death_districts with death_recoveries by state_id</li>
                            <li>Dropped duplicates</li>
                            <li>Recovered number of Covid-19 patients by summing up grouped data by state</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Health and demographics data</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The files titled pc11_demographics.csv and health_district_pc11.csv are from DLL India and
                        the Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Platform (SHRUG) (2020). The
                        demographics data is from the 2011 population census; the relevant variables are StateID,
                        UrbanShare, PopDens, StateName, SlumPop, TotPop, WorkPopGeo.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Air quality and forest data</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mean pollution data (ddl_pollution_sedac_lgd.csv) is from DLL India and includes data on
                        mean pollution per state. The state names were renamed according to the state name in
                        shapefile, merging on state ID.</li>
                    <li>Forest data (Indian_forest.csv and shrug_ec13_state_key.csv) is from the SHRUG platform.
                        This consists of a calculation of forest coverage by pixel density of each state
                        photographed by satellites between 2000 and 2014. 2014 forest data was used because it is
                        the most recent data available; the relevant variables are the total amount of forest
                        coverage and the maximum value of forest cover (percent) in each district. This data was
                        reformatted and cleaned by merging and averaging the data by state. States were renamed
                        according to the state names in the shapefile and merged with the shapefile.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Final dataframe</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The aforementioned cleaned data along with the Indian shapefile, were saved as the final
                        dataframe. The shape file was retrieved from Github user AnuragAnalog (2020) and contains
                        the boundaries of India.</li>
                    <li>The variables of interest are: Total number of hospitals, Total number of doctors, urban
                        share, population density, slum population, total population, working population, mean
                        pollution, forest data from 2000 until 2014, ec13_state_id, Covid-19 deaths and cases and
                        average.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The data has the following limitations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The India shapefile contains new states; for example, Ladakh became a state in 2019. Air
                        quality data is not available for newly-created states. However, since air quality data
                        overlaps with other known maps of India, the consequence of not having accurate mapping from
                        state to air quality is insignificant.</li>
                    <li>The forest data is from 2000 to 2014 while Covid-19 outbreak data start from 2020. The
                        forest condition might have changed between 2015 and 2019.</li>
                    <li>Demographic data comes from 2011.</li>
                    <li>The timeframe from which the mean population was taken is unknown.</li>
                    <li>Covid-19 cases and deaths change frequently, so the data will quickly become outdated.</li>
                    <li>Two states were dropped in this analysis, Ladakh and Telangana, because demographic data was
                        not available.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Spatial Visualization</h4>

                <p>Almost all states with high cases and deaths have a large number of total hospitals, doctors, work
                    population, total population, slum population, and mean pollution. These states also have a low
                    amount of forest coverage, total forest, and surprisingly, population density.</p>

                <h4>Regression</h4>

                <p>Based on the linear regression, an increase in all variables except forest coverage value will also
                    increase Covid-19 cases.</p>

                <p>There are 9 states in cluster 0 that have a medium number of total cases. In cluster 1, there are 17
                    states with a low number of cases. In cluster 2, there are 2 states with the highest number of
                    cases.</p>


                <h3>Observations</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>States with higher forest coverage generally have lower Covid-19 cases.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are a few outliers and exceptions to this pattern. The state with the most cases,
                                Maharashtra, has a relatively low forest coverage percentage. The high cases could be
                                due to the fact that there is a large population in Maharashtra.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Higher forest coverage has relatively less mean pollution.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On a larger scale, this pattern is consistent. This supports the point that forests and
                                pollution are negatively correlated.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Generally, there is a small positive correlation between pollution and total cases.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The mean squared error for this relationship is positive, so there is a slight
                                correlation, though not as strong as hypothesized. Forest coverage is a better predictor
                                of total cases. More research into the contributors to pollution would help identify the
                                specific causes of pollution and how they might affect Covid-19 cases.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>

                <p>In summary, states with lower forest coverage typically have higher pollution. Higher polluted states
                    tend to have higher populations. Polluted and populated states have a higher number of Covid-19
                    cases. These findings suggest that environmental factors like forest density and air quality impact
                    the transmission of Covid-19. Policies that improve air quality such as decreased fuel consumption
                    and limits on deforestation could be enacted as pandemic prevention policies.</p>
